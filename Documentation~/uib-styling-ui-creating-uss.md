# Creating and managing StyleSheets (USS)

In the **StyleSheets** pane, you can add a StyleSheet to the current UI Document (UXML) by using the "+" dropdown menu to the left of the **Create new selector...** field:
1. **Create New USS** - this will open a **Save File Dialog** allowing you to create a new StyleSheet in your project.
1. **Add Existing USS** - this will open the **Open File Dialog** allowing you to add an existing StyleSheet to the UI Document (UXML).

You can also access these options via the right-click menu anywhere inside the **StyleSheets** pane tree view.

To remove a StyleSheet from the active UI Document (UXML) you can right-click on the StyleSheet and select **Remove USS**. This will require a full save of all unsaved changes.

There is always a single **Active StyleSheet** that appears bold. If you create a new USS Selector from the **Create new selector...** field, it will be added to the **Active StyleSheet**. You can change the **Active StyleSheet** by right-clicking on a StyleSheet and choosing **Set as Active USS**.

When using Sub-Document editing, the StyleSheets belonging to the parent documents will appear grayed out. They are there to provide context but are otherwise read-only.
