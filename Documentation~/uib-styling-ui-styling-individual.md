# Styling individual elements inline

You can change any style property of an individual element by selecting it and going to the **Inline Styles** section of the **Inspector**.

Style fields that appear **bold** with a solid line on the left of the field label represent style properties that are already set, or **overridden**. It is important to keep track of these **overridden** style properties because they will always override the same property coming from a StyleSheet or from a C# default. You can unset or remove the **override** for a style property by right-click on the style field and choosing **Unset**.
