# UI Builder

UI Builder lets you visually create and edit UI using UIElements, UXML, and USS.

# Overview

![UI Builder Main Window](UIBuilderAnnotatedMainWindow.png)

## Explorer `#1` `#2`

Similar to the Hierarchy window in Unity, this gives you access to all components of the currently open documents.

### StyleSheet `#1`

This section lists all USS selectors in the main USS document referenced by the UXML document. Currently, UI Builder only supports a single USS document per UXML.

Here, you can create new selectors by clicking on the **StyleSheet** header and typing in the full name of the selector in the **Inspector**, or via the **Add new selector...** text field at the bottom of the list where you can more easily create simple class-based selectors.

Class names within selector names will be converted to pills that can be dragged onto elements in the **Hierarchy** below or onto elements in the **Canvas**.

Selecting a selector in this list will let you change its properties in the **Inspector**. You will also see highlighted in the **Canvas** all elements that are currently affected by this selector.

### Hierarchy `#2`

This section is a tree representing the current live hierarchy of your UXML document. You can select elements here to edit them via the **Inspector** and you can click-drag them to re-parent them.

Elements will appear in the tree using their `name` attribute if they have one set. If not they will appear using their C# type. You can double-click on an element to quickly rename it.

If you click on the `ï¸™` icon in the top right corner of the **Explorer**'s toolbar, you'll be able to see the element's type C# at all times (even if they have a name), and you can also see the element's current style class list.

## Library `#3` `#4`

This pane is similar to the **Project** window in Unity. It is a catered list of available UI elements, both standard ones provided by Unity and your own custom ones.

You can click-drag them into the **Explorer** pane or into the **Canvas** to instantiate them, or you can double-click them. If you hover over an item in this list, you should see a preview of it on the right side of the **Library** pane.

### Unity Elements `#3`

These are built-in common controls provided by Unity. They come with standard styling that will work for all supported Unity themes in the Editor and Runtime.

### Project Elements `#4`

This section is a tree of custom user elements. This includes other `.uxml` assets in the current project or custom C# elements (that inherit from `VisualElement` and have their `UxmlFactory` set up to be instantiable via UXML).

## Viewport `#5` `#6` `#7`

This is where you can see the current UXML document, running within a UI Builder-provided edit-time **Canvas** that you can resize to see how the UI would adapt to different host sizes in the wild.

In the tile bar of the **Viewport** pane you will see the name of the currently loaded document, as well as a `*` if there are unsaved changes.

### Toolbar `#5`

The **Toolbar** contains the **File** menu where you can create a **New** document, **Save** or **Save As** the current document, or **Open** another document.

It contains the **Current Theme** selection for quickly previewing your UI in dark or light themes without changing the entire Editor theme.

And it has a **Preview** button that lets you remove the selection layer on top of the **Canvas** that allows for click-selecting elements and allows you to interact with the UI you're building (ie. click on buttons, type in text fields, change expand/collapse foldout states).

### Canvas `#6` `#7`

Inside the **Viewport** you have the independently-sized **Canvas**. You can resize it via handles on the sides. This size, and everything else about the **Canvas** is purely to aid authoring and nothing is saved in the document itself.

Within the **Canvas**, you can click on elements to select them. Once selected, you can use the handles to change their size. For elements that have their **Inspector > Position > Position** set to **Relative**, only their height and width will be adjustable via the **Canvas** handles. To have full resizing and movement freedom you have to set the **Position** style to **Absolute**, but this is not the recommended way of using UIElements as it by-passes the automatic layouting functionality.

You can set the background color or image of the edit-time **Canvas** via the **Inspector** by first selecting the **Hierarchy** element in the **Explorer**. You can also have a live feed from a **Camera** as the background of your **Canvas** to get more context while building your UI without having to launch the full game.

## Code Previews `#8` `#9`

As you build your UI, all changes will either be saved to the UXML document or the USS document. You can see the generated UXML and USS text at any time in the **UXML Preview** and the **USS Preview** panes.

## Inspector `#10` `#11` `#12`

Equivalent to Unity's own **Inspector** window, this is where you can change properties and styles of the currently selected element or USS selector.

### Attributes `#10`

This is where you can change UXML attributes of a visual element like **Name**, **Tooltip**, or in the case of a text element, **Text**. These attributes are per-element can not be shared.

This section is only visible if you have a visual element selected.

### Inherited Styles `#11`

Styles can easily be shared between multiple elements so that you can make changes in one place and affect all uses. This is done via USS selectors which can change styles matching elements. Selectors can match on an element by either its name, style class, or C# type, or a combination of those, and/or a parent/child relationship.

But the simplest way to share styles is to assign one or more elements a style class (like `my-red-button`) and create a simple selector in the form `.my-red-button`.

To assign the selected element a style class, just type in the name in the **Style Class List** text field and press **Add Style Class to List**. If you already have a selector that matches, you should see the effects of the now-inherited styles immediately.

Alternatively, if you don't yet have a matching selector (and you've already applied some local styles via **Local Styles**), you can type in the name of your desired new selector (and style class) in the **Style Class List** text field and press **Extract Local Styles to New Class**. This will create a new USS selector (should see it in the **Explorer > StyleSheet**) and also add the style class to the current element.

At the bottom of the **Style Class List** foldout you should see (if any) all style classes currently on the selected element as pills. You can click the `x` to remove a style (ex. remove the default styling on a Unity-provided button). You can also double-click a pill to either create a simple selector for it if it doesn't exists or select the existing simple USS selector if it does exist.

At any time you can see all matching selectors and inherited styles inside the **Matching Selectors** foldout.

This section is only visible if you have a visual element selected.

### Local Styles `#12`

This section applies to both elements and USS selectors. For elements, any changes in the **Local Styles** will be overrides applied after all inherited styles and stored in the UXML document itself as inline styles. For USS selectors, any changes in the **Local Styles** will be added as properties in the USS rule in the StyleSheet. In all cases, you can see exactly which styles are set by looking for the white/black left borders and bolded text, similar to Prefab overridden fields.

1. Pressing **File > Save** will ask for new file names for USS and UXML if it is the first save, otherwise, it will overwrite the previously saved/loaded files.
1. Saving should work even if the opened assets have been moved or renamed (in which case, the Builder should update the USS Style paths inside the UXML document).
1. Pressing **File > Save As...** will always ask for a new file name and save as a copy of the current document.
1. Pressing **File > Open...** will display an Open File Dialog and let you select a `.uxml` asset inside your Project.

### Save Dialog

1. Entering paths that do not start with "Assets/" or "Packages/" will show an invalid path message and the Save button will be disabled.
1. Updating the UXML Path field will automatically update the USS Path field to match, until the USS Path field is changed manually.
1. Entering file names without extensions will still add the correct extensions when creating the assets.

1. Absolute position elements have all 4 side and 4 corner handles visible.
1. Absolute position elements have 4 anchor handles visible to set or unset the `left`/`right`/`top`/`bottom` inline styles.
1. Absolute position elements can be click-drag moved, changing `top`/`right`/`left`/`bottom` inline styles depending on anchor state.
1. Resize and position handles change different styles depeneding on anchor state (ie. if `left` and `right` styles are set, changing the width changes the `right` style - otherwise, changing the width changes the `width` style).
1. Canvas size will be restored after Domain Reload or Window reload. It will be reset when opening a new document.
1. When changing Width or Height in the Inspector, the corresponding resize handles in the canvas will highlight.
1. When hovering over elements in the Canvas, the corresponding entry in the Hierarchy will highlight.
1. When hovering over elements in the Canvas, all Explorer entries of style selectors that match this element will highlight.
1. If the Canvas is bigger than the Viewport, a **Fit Canvas** button will appear that will resize the Canvas to fit in the Viewport.
1. Canvas size will be remembered for each asset and restored when loading the asset. It also means it will survive Editor restarts.
1. Clicking the **Hierarchy** item in the Explorer will display the Canvas options in the Inspector:
    1. Can see and change the Canvas height and width.
    1. Can set the custom Canvas background color/image Opacity.
    1. Can set the Canvas background to be a solid color via the Color Background mode.
    1. Can set the Canvas background to be an image, can set the ScaleMode of the image, and can have the Canvas resize to match the image via the **Fit Canvas to Image** button.
    1. Can set the Canvas background to be a render texture for a chosen Camera.
    1. All of these settings will be remembered next time you open the same UXML document.

## Previews

### UXML
