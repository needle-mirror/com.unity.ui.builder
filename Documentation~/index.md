# Overview

The **UI Builder** lets you visually create and edit UI assets such as UI Documents (UXML / `.uxml` assets), and StyleSheets (USS / `.uss` files), that you use with Unity's **UI Toolkit** (formerly UIElements). After you set up the UI Builder package, you can open the UI Builder window from the menu (**Window > UI Toolkit > UI Builder**), or from the Project window (double-click a `.uxml` asset).

> Note: In Unity 2019.x, you open the UI Builder from the **Window > UI > UI Builder** menu.

> Note: UI Builder is the visual authoring tool for UI Toolkit. It does not include runtime support. To enable runtime support in Unity 2020.1 and later, install the UI Toolkit package. For details, see this post on the Unity Forum: https://forum.unity.com/threads/ui-toolkit-1-0-preview-available.927822/.

1. **StyleSheets**: Manage StyleSheets and USS Selectors to share styles across UI Documents (UXML) and elements.
1. **Hierarchy**: Select, reorder, reparent, cut, copy, paste, delete elements in the UI hierarchy of your document.
1. **Library**: Create new elements or instance other UI Documents (UXML).
1. **Viewport**: See what your UI Document (UXML) looks like and edit elements visually directly on the Canvas.
1. **Code Previews**: See what the UI Builder is creating as text for both the UI Document (UXML)
 and the StyleSheets (USS).
1. **Inspector**: Use it to change the attributes and style properties of the selected element or USS selector.
