# Creating and managing UI Documents (UXML)

The currently open and active UI Document (UXML) asset name is displayed in both the **Hierarchy** pane as a root tree item as well as in the **Canvas** header inside the **Viewport**. An asterisk **&#42;** next to the name indicates unsaved changes.

UI Builder will always start, by default, with a blank unsaved UI Document (UXML). This will display as `<unsaved file>*.uxml`. You can start working within this UI Document (UXML) and then create it as an asset on disk later when you save for the first time.

You can open an existing UI Document (UXML) by either:
1. Using the **File** menu inside the UI Builder's **Viewport** pane toolbar and choosing **Open..**.
1. Finding the document in the **Project** tab of the **Library** pane and either right-clicking and choosing **Open in UI Builder** or clicking the little box icon to the left of the tree view item.
1. Finding the document in the Unity Project Window and double-clicking on it. Note, if you already have the document open in the UI Builder and you double-click on it in the Unity Project Window, the UI Document (UXML) will open using your default text editor or IDE.

You can save any changes to the active UI Document (UXML) by using the **File > Save** menu in the UI Builder's **Viewport** pane toolbar. **Ctrl/CMD + S** _might_ also work but the UI Builder window needs to be in focus. Note that the Unity project-wide Save will _not_ save the active UI Document (UXML) open in the UI Builder.
